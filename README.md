Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the phrase object is updated so that it displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

After building this project, you'll have another great portfolio piece to show off your skills, a fun app that you can share with your friends and family, and a good understanding of the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
